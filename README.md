# Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: a client application and a server application. Together, they form a comprehensive web application designed to provide a rich user experience and robust backend services.

## Client Application

The client application is built using React, leveraging a variety of libraries to enhance its functionality. It features a modern user interface designed with Ant Design components, state management via Redux Toolkit, and routing with React Router DOM. The application also integrates Stripe for payment processing and uses Axios for HTTP requests, among other features.

Key dependencies include:
- React and React DOM
- Ant Design
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- Moment.js
- Stripe Checkout

The client side is focused on providing an interactive and user-friendly interface, making extensive use of modern JavaScript features and React's component-based architecture.

## Server Application

The server application (details not provided in the excerpt) is assumed to be a backend service designed to support the client application. It likely handles tasks such as:
- Managing user authentication and authorization
- Processing and storing data from the client
- Integrating with third-party services like payment gateways
- Providing RESTful APIs for the client to consume

The server side is crucial for handling business logic, database operations, security, and data persistence, ensuring that the client application can operate smoothly and efficiently.

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to provide a seamless and integrated web application experience, where the client and server work together to offer a range of functionalities from user management to payment processing. It's designed to showcase the power of modern web development frameworks and libraries in creating scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications.

## Getting Involved

Contributors are welcome to both the client and server parts of the project. Whether you're interested in front-end React development, back-end services, or both, there's room for your skills and contributions here.
